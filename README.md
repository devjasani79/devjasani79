## Product-Focused Full-Stack Developer  
From product thinking to performance-driven, scalable web systems

I am a product-focused full-stack developer with hands-on experience building production-ready web applications through freelancing, internships, and independent projects. I graduated in 2024 with a BBA-CA degree (SPPU affiliated) and have since worked across the full software development lifecycle — from requirement analysis and system design to implementation, optimization, and deployment.

My engineering approach emphasizes clean architecture, performance, scalability, and long-term maintainability. I prefer working on problems that require thoughtful system design rather than short-lived feature implementations. I enjoy collaborating closely with product and design to build solutions that are technically sound and aligned with real user needs.

I aim to build software systems that are reliable, scalable, and designed to remain valuable well beyond their initial release.

## Professional Summary

Full-stack developer with experience across freelancing, internships, and independent product development. Graduated in 2024 with a BBA-CA degree (SPPU affiliated) and have worked on real-world web applications involving authentication, data-heavy workflows, and performance-sensitive systems.

Strong focus on system design, clean architecture, and scalability. Comfortable working end-to-end — from translating product requirements into technical designs to delivering production-ready frontend and backend solutions.

## About Me

I approach software development with a product-first mindset and an emphasis on long-term engineering quality. Rather than optimizing only for speed of delivery, I focus on building systems that remain maintainable, scalable, and reliable as complexity grows.

My experience spans frontend development with modern React and Next.js, backend API design, authentication workflows, and database-driven applications. I value clarity in code, thoughtful abstractions, and close collaboration with product and design to build solutions that solve real problems effectively.
